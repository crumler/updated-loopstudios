## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project heavily relied on absolute positioning for several items, so that was a great learning experience for me.  While I understand that absolute positioning has more or less gone away thanks to the creation of CSS Flexbox and Grid, there are still some use cases for it.

This project also allowed me to become more familiar with the awesome power of custom properties and utilities.

### Continued development

While I was able to successfully create a solution for it, I am still planning to become more familiar with the functionality of mobile hamburger menus.
